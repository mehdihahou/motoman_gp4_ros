# Hello Everyone

> Project Description: This project was build for controlling the smalest robot of motoman yaskawa GP4 over ROS Idustrial. The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of software libraries and tools for creating robotic applications. From pilots to state-of-the-art algorithms, and with powerful development tools, ROS has what you need for your next industrial robotics project. And everything is open source. Since the launch of ROS in 2007, a lot has changed in the robotics and ROS community.
